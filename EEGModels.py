"""
 A Convolutional Neural Network models for EEG Signal Processing and Classification, using Keras and Tensorflow

 Requirements:
    (1) tensorflow == 2.X (as of this writing, 2.0 - 2.3 have been verified
        as working)
 
 To run the EEG/MEG ERP classification sample script, you will also need

    (4) mne >= 0.17.1
    (5) PyRiemann >= 0.2.5
    (6) scikit-learn >= 0.20.1
    (7) matplotlib >= 2.2.3
